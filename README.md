# IDS706 Pandas Assignment by Kaisen Yao

[![CI](https://github.com/kaisenyao/Pandas_descriptive/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaisenyao/Pandas_descriptive/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)

This repository contains my work for the **Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script** assignment in IDS 706. The script reads a dataset, generates summary statistics, and creates a data visualization. To use it, simply link it to a GitHub codespace and wait for the devcontainer to run the Makefile, which will execute the following tasks: install, format, lint, and test.

This repository includes the following components:

* `.devcontainer`
* `Makefile`
* `requirements.txt`
* `README.md` 
* `githubactions` 
* `Dockerfile`

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a Python script that performs descriptive statistics on a given dataset using Pandas. The script:
1. Reads a dataset (CSV).
2. Generates key summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
3. Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of a numerical column.

The project uses `matplotlib` for data visualization and provides a markdown report summarizing the results.

## Preparation
1. Open codespaces.
2. Load repo to codespaces.
3. Wait for the installation of all the requirements in `requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Makefile code: `make all`.

## About the Dataset
This dataset provides details regarding employee salaries within a company. Each row corresponds to an individual employee, with columns capturing various attributes, including age, gender, education, job title, experience, and salary.

**Columns**:
1. Age: The age of the employee, given as a numerical value in years.
2. Gender: The employee’s gender, categorized as male or female.
3. Education Level: Indicates the employee’s highest educational qualification, categorized as high school, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or PhD.
4. Job Title: The position held by the employee within the company, with possible titles such as manager, analyst, engineer, or administrator.
5. Years of Experience: The number of years the employee has been working, represented as a numeric value.
6. Salary: The employee’s annual income, listed in US dollars, varying based on job title, experience, and education.

## Outputs

1. **Summary Report**: The script computes and outputs important summary statistics rounded to 2 decimal places for numerical columns like `Age`, `Years of Experience`, and `Salary`.

2. **Salary Distribution Visualization**: A histogram showcasing the distribution of salary in the dataset is generated.

## Example Output

Here’s an example of the summary statistics generated by the script:

|       | Age   | Years of Experience | Salary   |
|-------|-------|---------------------|----------|
| count | 373.0 | 373.0               | 373.00   |
| mean  | 37.43 | 10.03               | 100577.35|
| std   | 7.07  | 6.56                | 48240.01 |
| min   | 23.00 | 0.00                | 350.00   |
| 50%   | 36.00 | 9.00                | 95000.00 |
| max   | 53.00 | 25.00               | 250000.00|

The script provides a clean and concise summary of the dataset's most important numerical fields
